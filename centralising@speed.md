#Centralising at speed#
Agile development builds heavily on getting feedback from users and getting it fast. For multi-brand and multi-country organisations centralisation is needed to enable the set-up of advanced platforms and building expert skills such as development, big data and online marketing.

##TTT (total throughput time)
One of the main concerns or KPI's to measure in this case is the total throughput time. This value should represent the time it takes an idea to become a live feature in the platform. We see almost all our clients measure the team velocity, the platform velocity. This helps in supporting development teams to improve their performance, but could create sub-optimisation when ideas are stuck in different phases.

The absense of this metric and the subsequent focus on the total chain is clearly seen in the project governance.


Not entirely coincidental, this aligns with the agile manifesto.

Focus on feedback instead of requirements


Feedback committee not steering committee

For another client, we helped on the implementation of their new commerce platform.

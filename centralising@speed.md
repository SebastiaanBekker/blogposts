Centralising at speed

As eCommerce ambitions grow larger and platforms become more mature, we see an increase in centralisation with our clients. 

Three factors drive this trend: 

- Quick and easy deployment of best practices. <<<opzoeken of hier cijfers van zijn >>>

- Centralisation of scarce resources, licences and expertise, incuding external support. 

- Economies of scale. Especially on back-end connections it saves to have one platform and one integration layer or connection layer. 

This trend seems at odds with the current need for speed in eCommerce environments. Especially for multi-brand, multi-country corporations, centralisation feels as returning to the days of battling for specs and getting attention from the development team. 

Together with our clients, we've tackled this dilemma. Their approaches give an insight on how to organise this during development and the entire life cycle of the platform. All have one thing in common: their focus on getting feedback from real customers as soon as possible and to validate in one way or another the expected value of this feedback and the improvements. Without these, political agenda's will influence the backlog and the process will end up being entirely internal focused.

Not entirely coincidental, this aligns with the agile manifesto. 

Focus on feedback instead of requirements

One client wanted a new, future-proof version of their European B2B dealer platform. We jointly developed a 0.9 version of the platform. The functionality  was there, the business rules and datac-connections were in place. In stead of filling a backlog for the last mile, we implemented Qtest. We asked each country to assign a relevant set of users, which we gave access to the platform and their account. Qtest enabled the product owners to quickly get feedback and to structure the backlog

Feedback committee not steering committee

For another client, we helped on the implementation of their new commerce platform.
